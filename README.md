Guessing Game with Free Monads
===

Welcome to the Guessing Game project written in [Scala 3](https://www.scala-lang.org), designed as a practical demonstration for presentations on Free Monads. This project serves as a learning tool to showcase the creation of a Free Monad, the DSL, and interpreting it with different interpreters. It was originally used as a live coding example during a presentation to illustrate these concepts.
